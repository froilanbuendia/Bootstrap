      <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my page. I am a freshman at CSULB, who is an aspiring
        Computer Engineer. I have two brothers, one sister, and six dogs. Taking
        care of six dogs is really demanding, but they have taught me many
        lessons to learn from.

      <h3>What Interests Me?</h3>
      <p>
        Along with using technology, I also love to play sports, espcially
        basketball and track, and play video games.

      <h3>My Coding Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I am not the best coder in the world, however, I am improving everyday
        to hopefully reach my goal and become a Computer Engineer. As a freshman
        who is relatively new to coding, I am still getting accustomed to basic
        programming languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, and HTML. Linked
        below are youtube videos of a few of my projects for CECS 174, which is
        the current programing class I am taking.
