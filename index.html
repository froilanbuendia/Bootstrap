        <p class="lead"> 
        Welcome to my page. I am a freshman at CSULB, who is an aspiring
        Computer Engineer. I am not the best coder in the world, however, I am improving everyday
        to hopefully reach my goal and become a Computer Engineer. As a freshman
        who is relatively new to coding, I am still getting accustomed to basic
        programming languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, and HTML. Linked
        below is a youtube video for my Roman Numeral Calculator project for CECS 174, which is
        the current programing class I am taking. Along with using technology, I also love to play sports, espcially
        basketball and track, and play video games. With the current conditions,
        I have been trying to learn different hobbies. One big hobby i have picked
        up the past year is learning how to pay the ukulele. I have never played an 
        instrument in my life so it was definitely a hard task to pick up. Learning 
        how to the play the ukulele gave me a new sense of confidence that I can do 
        anything once I put in effort. I have two brothers, one sister, and six dogs. I am an avid
        Disney fan and had a Disney Annual Pass for many years before the pandemic and
        can't wait to go again.
